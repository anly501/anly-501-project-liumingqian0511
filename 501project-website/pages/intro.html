    <p style="text-align:left; font-size:20px;;">The topic of this project is medical insurance and its impact on individual health. Reported by Investopedia in 2021, the United States continues to ranks highest in healthcare spending among the developed nations of the world.  According to data released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2019, the U.S. rate was a staggering $11,072 per capita. This data reflects the importance of health insurance in the United States and the size of the industry. However, many people believes that such high spedning on health insurance was due the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which required Americans to buy health insurance. The idea behind that is the government-mandated health insurance might yield a health dividend. In addition, good health insurance can be very expensive. It is inevitable that many health insurance buyers were purchasing it without knowing its significance, or even reluctant to get one. In this project, I will analyze and summarize the data collected from the health insurance industry and health insurance buyers, and I will use models and explainatory data visualizations to answer the following questions:</p>
    <ol style = "font-size:20px;">
        <li>Whether and by how much health-care use falls when the price of health care goes up?</li>
        <li>Whether more expensive health insurance coverage causes better health?</li>
        <li>whether different types of insurance (free, coinsurance, catastrophic,Deductible, etc) affect health differently.</li>
        <li>Does the level of education affect health-care use?</li>
        <li>Do older people tend to purchase more expansive and generous insurance plan?</li>
        <li>Does a better HI plan increase face-to-face visits and hospital admissions?</li>
        <li>How does the medical insurance industry affect U.S revenue?</li>
        <li>Whether and by how much does health insurance impact onn individual mental health?</li>
        <li>What type of insurance are people most willing to purchase? (Car, Property, Health, Business etc)</li>
        <li>How does Medicare affect hospital revenue?</li>
    </ol>
