    <p style="text-align:left; font-size:20px;;">I gathered my text data from Twitter API. Click <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xnNmFAcLHU_A61lNO1FmAEs7HM70jgIk?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> to access the Python API code. Firstly, I created a list of search words that included 10 keywords related to the project topic. For each keyword in the search list, I gathered 300 tweets contain those keywords and stored them <a href="https://github.com/anly501/anly-501-project-liumingqian0511/tree/main/501-project-website/datagather/twitter_data">here</a> as json file. Based on the output of WordCloud, I created another list of 10 words that are most frequently shown in tweets with the hashtag "insurance". As you can see from the result in the <a href="./WordCloud_R.html" target="_blank">WordCloud</a> tab, even without spefifying the type of insurance, the results of most referenced words are still health related. I looped through each json file and sorted the keywords by their frequency of reference in tweets. A frequency dataset was created along with a bar plot to visualize some information about the dataset.</p>

    <P style="text-align:left; font-size:20px;;">As shown in the bar plot, "health", "cover" and "doctor" are the most frequently referenced words besides "insurance" in tweets related to medical insurance. This is just a naive look at the dataset, more analysis will be done on the text. </P>
